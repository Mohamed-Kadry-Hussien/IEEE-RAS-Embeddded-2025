 * Bonus:
 * - The message indicates that you have been given a specific memory address (0x600000),
 *   or any similar address, and you are encouraged to explore how to access and write
 *   to it.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Accessing memory directly using hexadecimal addresses (like 0x600000) is called
 *   "direct memory access".
 * - This is typically used in low-level programming (e.g., C or Assembly), especially in
 *   embedded systems where developers interact with hardware directly.
 * - Such operations are **risky** because incorrect use can lead to:
 *     - System crashes
 *     - Data corruption
 *     - Security vulnerabilities
 * - Therefore, it should only be done in **controlled environments**, like:
 *     - Operating system kernels
 *     - Bootloaders
 *     - Embedded firmware
 *     - Learning/testing environments (e.g., virtual machines)
